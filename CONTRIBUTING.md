# What should I know before contributing

LookAtMe is an android library that helps making a VideoView which detects user's face and checks if the eyes are open and play the video only when both of the above conditions are met. The video is paused otherwise. 

This is a simple project android library but is a lot of fun when you think how you can use it at different places.

LookAtMe uses GoogleVision to provide various other features and ofcourse we welcome every idea and contribution :smile:
