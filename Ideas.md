## Ideas:

### 1. Trigger on successive 3 times eye blinking 

- If the user blinks their eyes 3 times in succession, then the app skips to the next video.

- This idea would increase the functionality of the app by giving the user more functions that are easily accessible. Blinking your eyes 3 times doesn't naturally happen, but users can remember the command and execute it quickly. 

- The potential use case for this feature is in a dedicated media player, which requires simple commands that the user can use to interact with the video.
